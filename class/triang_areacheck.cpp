/*Write a C++ program that defines a Triangle class with methods to calculate its area and perimeter.
Two instances of the Triangle class are created, and their parameters are
initialized with specific side lengths. The program should calculate the area
and perimeter for both instances. Additionally, it should determine which
triangle has the greater area and print out its details. The objects are
defined as triangle1 = (8, 6, 10) and triangle2 = (6, 8, 10).

Hints:
perimeter = sum of all sides
s = perimeter() / 2
Area = s(s-side1)(s -side2)(s-side3)
